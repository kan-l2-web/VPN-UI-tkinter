# Simple UI interface

This simple UI interface is written on the ttkbootstrap and tkinter library

## Install library 
Before running the script, I strongly recommend installing the libraries and adding your VPN client (instead of PyVPN)
```
pip install ttkbootstrap
pip install PyVpn
```
## Gallery
